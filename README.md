# OpenCV-AI-Competition-UTAR4Vision
Please Refer the directory "Demo" for some demonstration image of the project.<br>
Thanks!<br>

## Terminology
1. **OAK-D**
- an OpenCV AI Kit (with depth) device 
- has a stereo camera setup, and have Intel VPU chip in it
- [OAK-D specs](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1098OAK.html#bw1098oak)
2. **Pipeline**
- a pipeline is the workflow on the OAK-D side, 
- it consists of nodes (such as monocam node, neural network node, and etc.), together with the connections between them

## Utilites file

### depthai_utils
Contains the code for each of the Pipeline required in this project
The Pipelines involved:
1. **Navigation**
- obstacle detection
- obstacle avoidance
- social distancing
2. **Walkable road path segmentation**
- road path segmentation for pedestrian's perspective
3. **Pedestrian traffic light detection**
- to detect and classify the traffic light for pedestrian
4. **Protective Equipment (PPE) detection**
- to detect hand sanitizer/face mask/thermometer

### task_utils
1. **Speech Recognition**
- an OOP object for speech recognition and voice command
- designed for multithreading
2. **Navigator**
- contains the functions for obstacle avoidance, social distancing

## Sample Codes
1. **main.py**
- the consolidated code
- flowchart will be added soon
2. **oakd_navigation.py**
- demo code for navigation
3. **oakd_segmentation.py**
- demo code for road segmentation
4. **oakd_traffic_light.py**
